##:Role 1: Group and prepare data by attack type.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Load a CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/gowth/Desktop/kag/globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(data)  s


```
```{r}
library(dplyr)   
library(tidyr)  
library(ggplot2) 
```

```{r}

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(data))  # Total missing values
colSums(is.na(data))  # Missing values per column

```
```{r}
colnames(data)



```



```{r}
#cleaned_data <- na.omit(data) #remove missing values
#cleaned_data <- data %>% distinct()  # remove duplicates ..

```

```{r}
# Grouping by primary attack type and summarizing attack counts
attack_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(attacktype1_txt) %>%
  summarise(
    total_attacks = n(),
    avg_kills = mean(nkill, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average number of fatalities per attack type
    avg_wounded = mean(nwound, na.rm = TRUE)  # Average number of wounded per attack type
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_attacks))  # Sort in descending order

# View summary
print(attack_summary)


```
