##:Role 1: Group and prepare data by attack type.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Load a CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/gowth/Desktop/kag/globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(data)  s


```
```{r}
library(dplyr)   
library(tidyr)  
library(ggplot2) 
```

```{r}

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(data))  # Total missing values
colSums(is.na(data))  # Missing values per column

```
```{r}
cleaned_data <- na.omit(data) #remove missing values
cleaned_data <- data %>% distinct()  # remove duplicates

```

```{r}


```
